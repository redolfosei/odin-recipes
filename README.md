This project is a personal simple recipe blog.
This was the very first assignment with the updated Odin Project. I updated my knowledge on how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the mac and linux terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. 
I created ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. 
I was able to organize "beginner friendly" clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer.
